    <h1>Jose's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my newest portfolio! It's my absolute pleasure you have you visit my most recent work. My name is Jose R. Munguia and I'm currently in the process of becoming a full-stack developer with MIT's Mern Stack Program. After five years in the education industry abroad, I've dreamt of fulfilling dreams in the tech industry using my very own hands instead of depending on the skills of others. Therefore, I'd like to show you the progress I've made during these last weeks. On this website, you will find three of my recent projects:
        <ol>
            <li>PacMen</li>
            <li>Eye Ball Exercise</li>
            <li>Real Time Bus Tracking</li>
        </ol><br/><br/>
